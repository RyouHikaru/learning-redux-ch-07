# Chapter 7

This chapter focused on refactoring the previous Blog project (from Chapter 5) to use RTK Query.

Topics covered:
* State normalization (ids and entities)
* Use of `createApi` to create an API slice
* Use of `injectEndpoints` to build endpoints which will be generated as custom Hooks
* Use of `query` and `mutation` for CRUD operations
* Providing and invalidating tags for auto re-fetching
* Optimistic updates for immediate UI response
